Project Name: Genetic Algorithm for Multiple Sequence Alignment (GA-MSA)
Description
This project implements Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) in Python. It takes DNA/protein sequences from a FASTA file and aligns them using evolutionary techniques. The alignment is evaluated using a fitness function that rewards matches and penalizes mismatches and gaps.

The final alignment is displayed with colored characters, where:
🟢 Green = Perfect match
🔴 Red = Mismatch
🟡 Yellow = Gaps

Features
✅ Reads sequences from a FASTA file 📄
✅ Uses Genetic Algorithm (GA) for sequence alignment 🧬
✅ Implements Selection, Crossover, and Mutation 🔄
✅ Supports custom scoring for alignment evaluation ⚖️
✅ Displays results with colored output using colorama 🎨

Usage
1️⃣ Add your sequences to a FASTA file.
2️⃣ Run the Python script.
3️⃣ The best-aligned sequences will be printed with their alignment score.

Future Improvements
🔹 Implement BLOSUM62 or other scoring matrices.
🔹 Optimize mutation strategy for better convergence.
🔹 Add gap penalty tuning for different sequence types.
